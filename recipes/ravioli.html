    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><strong>Ravioli Dough</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Ravioli Filling</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pesto-Alfredo Cream sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Egg Wash</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mound flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat eggs, water, and olive oil in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing egg and flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling: Mix ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley until well combined. Set the filling aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Stir in heavy cream; increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan cheese until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce over medium-low heat in a separate saucepan.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat egg and 1 tablespoon of water together in a small bowl to make the egg wash.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling in 1-teaspoon portions onto the dough, 1-inch apart.</li>
        <li>Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta; use your fingers to press around each portion of filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Cut out individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Use your fingers to seal the edges.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.</li>
    </ol>
